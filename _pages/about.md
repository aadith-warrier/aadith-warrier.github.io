Hello! I am Aadith Warrier, a passionate undergraduate researcher and engineer pursuing a B.E in Mechanical Engineering at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. My work spans various interdisciplinary domains, including autonomous robotics, deep learning, and computer vision.

I have had the privilege of conducting research at the Embedded Systems and Robotics Lab and the MultiCog Lab at BITS Pilani, where I developed innovative solutions for autonomous systems and image enhancement under low visibility. Additionally, I interned at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, designing advanced inspection tools using soft actuators.
