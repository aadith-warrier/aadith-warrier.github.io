At **CRISS Robotics**, we developed prototype Mars Rovers for the **International Rover Challenge (IRC)**. Both rovers were equipped with advanced mechanical systems and innovative features to tackle Martian-like terrain, performing complex scientific and maintenance tasks. As the Mechanical Lead at CRISS, I led the design and integration of the mechanical systems, including suspension, chassis, and robotic arms.

Our rover used a four wheel differential drive mechanism with a double rocker suspension linked by a differential bar. The robotic arm has 5 degrees of freedom and is capable of manipulating objects of upto 5 kg.
