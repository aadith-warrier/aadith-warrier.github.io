The Firebird VI project is a ROS2 library for simulating the Firebird VI robot from NEX Robotics. This project aims to provide a comprehensive simulation environment for robotics enthusiasts and researchers.

The repository is organized into various modules, each focusing on different aspects of the simulation. These modules include:

- **Navigation:** Autonomous navigation with Collision Avoidance using the Nav2 Library.
- **Mapping:** SLAM using RTAB Map package.
- **Robot Description:** SDF model of the Firebird VI with a OakD Lite RGBD sensor.
